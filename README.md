# Gravity Simulator

## Overview

This Gravity Simulator is an interactive web application that allows users to simulate the effect of gravity from different celestial bodies on spawned balls within a canvas environment. The project builds upon the base tutorial provided by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPuSvdBGrpE), with several enhancements for a more dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Celestial Gravity Simulation**: Users can select the gravity of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, or the Sun to see how it affects the movement of the balls.
- **Ball Spawning**: A button allows users to spawn balls at random positions with random velocities.
- **Dynamic Star Background**: A moving star background adds to the immersive experience of the simulator.
- **Collision Detection and Resolution**: Balls bounce off each other and the canvas edges, simulating elastic collisions.
- **Reset Functionality**: Users can reset the simulation to clear all balls from the canvas.

## Enhancements Over Base Tutorial

- Added functionality for simulating gravity from different planets and the Sun.
- Implemented a dynamic, moving star background to enhance visual appeal.
- Enhanced collision detection and resolution for balls, including elastic collisions.
- Included controls for resetting the simulation and spawning new balls.

## Setup

To set up the Gravity Simulator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the `simulation.html` file in a modern web browser.

No external dependencies are required, as the project uses native HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript features.

## Usage

- Use the buttons in the control panel to select a celestial body's gravity. This will affect how the balls move within the canvas.
- Click the "Spawn Ball" button to add a new ball to the simulation.
- To reset the simulation and remove all balls, click the "Reset" button.
